description: Load the Doctrina read pack for a task, in read order
argument-hint: [capability]
---

Assemble the context for **automateQA** before doing any work.

Run `doctrina context $ARGUMENTS --concat` and read the output top to bottom:
AGENTS.md → product.md → the capability spec(s) → open changes → accepted ADRs.
With no capability it includes every active spec. It excludes the change
archive by design — run `doctrina why <capability>` when you need history.

Do this for ANY task (review, debug, a question), not only new work.
