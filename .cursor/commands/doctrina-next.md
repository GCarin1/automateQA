# /doctrina-next — next step for automateQA

Decide the next step from the framework's own signals.

1. Run `doctrina next` and `doctrina status` to see open work and gate health.
2. Do the single highest-priority action it names (resume a change, apply a
   delta, archive, accept an ADR, fix index drift, …).
3. Re-run `doctrina next` to confirm the item cleared.

Use the read-only commands first; never guess what is pending.
