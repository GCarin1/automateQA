# /doctrina-context — read pack for automateQA

Assemble the context before doing any work.

Run `doctrina context <capability> --concat` and read top to bottom:
AGENTS.md → product.md → the capability spec(s) → open changes → accepted ADRs.
With no capability it includes every active spec. The change archive is
excluded by design — run `doctrina why <capability>` when you need history.

Do this for ANY task (review, debug, a question), not only new work.
