# AGENTS.md — automateQA

Operational source of truth for AI coding agents working in this
repository. Follows the open AGENTS.md standard; the Doctrina framework
artifacts live under `.doctrina/`.

## What this repo is

Template de automação de testes web em Python: um padrão de estrutura e
escrita de testes adotável por qualquer time. Código em inglês, docs em pt-BR (ADR 0004).

## Working from intent (you drive; the human stays passive)

You — the AI agent — run the Doctrina commands. The human gives a brief
prompt and approves; do not make them run the CLI or hand-author artifacts.

- **Bootstrap.** No capability in `.doctrina/specs/`, or an intake still
  `Status: pending`? The specs are not written: run `doctrina intake --text
  "<description>"` and execute the printed playbook in one pass (existing
  codebase: `doctrina work --from-diff`). After conversion the specs are the
  only source of truth — never edit `intake.md` to change requirements.
- **Day-to-day.** Start every session with `doctrina prime` (gates, rules,
  open work in one read). Turn any request into a change with `doctrina work
  "<prompt>"` and follow the printed playbook. Preview a close with `doctrina
  change check <id>`; close with `doctrina close <id>`. Unsure what's next?
  `doctrina next`. Before compaction or handover: `doctrina handoff`.

## Doctrina command surface (generated — reach for these, don't hand-author)

Every command, with the moment you reach for it. The CLI scaffolds from
canonical templates and syncs `index.json`. Flags: `doctrina <cmd> --help`.
**Bootstrap**
- `doctrina init` — scaffold AGENTS.md and .doctrina/. *When:* starting a project that has no AGENTS.md yet.
- `doctrina intake` — store the intent and print the bootstrap playbook. *When:* you have a full project description and no specs yet.
- `doctrina adapter list|add|remove` — install/remove agent adapters (additive). *When:* adding or removing an agent's pointer files.
**Orient**
- `doctrina prime (session start)` — gates, open work and next steps in one read (--rules for the full standing rules). *When:* at the START of every session.
- `doctrina context [<cap>] --for "<task>" --concat` — the read pack, assembled to fit a token budget. *When:* before working on any task, to load the right files.
- `doctrina show` — point-read a single artifact by reference. *When:* you need one requirement, criterion, or ADR, not a file.
- `doctrina search` — search the artifact tree, grouped by category. *When:* you do not know which artifact mentions a term.
- `doctrina status` — index, coverage, trace, and artifact counts. *When:* you need the health of the tree at a glance.
- `doctrina next` — the recommended next workflow action. *When:* you finished something and do not know what follows.
- `doctrina why` — provenance: intent, proof, ADRs, and history. *When:* you need to justify or trace a capability's existence.
- `doctrina handoff (before compaction/handover)` — a resume note: open work, task state, next command. *When:* BEFORE compaction or handing over to another session.
**Change**
- `doctrina triage` — classify the lane (product/runtime/chore) and check the declared runtime surface. *When:* a request arrives — BEFORE scaffolding, especially if it smells like an incident.
- `doctrina work "<prompt>" (--capability · --chore · --from-diff · --quiet)` — scaffold a change and print the playbook to execute. *When:* a request arrives that changes behaviour (triage says PRODUCT).
- `doctrina spec new|list|set` — create, list, and edit capability specs. *When:* a capability needs creating or its headers advancing.
- `doctrina change new|apply|archive|check|tick|abandon` — drive a change by hand — check --verbose previews every delta. *When:* driving a change through its lifecycle by hand.
- `doctrina contract new|list|check` — own and verify the integration surface. *When:* the change touches ports, env vars, or public endpoints.
- `doctrina decision new|accept|land|supersede|list|scope` — record, accept, land, scope, and supersede ADRs. *When:* the change decides something a later session must not relitigate.
- `doctrina skill new|list|suggest` — capture on-demand procedural memory. *When:* a lesson is worth not relearning.
- `doctrina intent add|list` — append and list product intent anchors. *When:* new product intent appears after the intake.
**Gate**
- `doctrina clarify --all (--lang pt|en)` — smell-test Markdown for ambiguity. *When:* before applying, or before opening a PR.
- `doctrina validate (--fix)` — schema, structure, EARS, and index drift. *When:* after any artifact edit, and before considering work done.
- `doctrina coverage --strict` — acceptance criteria against cited evidence. *When:* before claiming a capability is proven.
- `doctrina trace --strict` — intent provenance across the tree. *When:* checking that product intent still maps to capabilities.
- `doctrina review` — conformance of your changes vs specs/ADRs/contracts. *When:* before handing work back, to self-review it.
- `doctrina verify` — the project's declared typecheck/test/build checks. *When:* the real build gate must run.
- `doctrina close <id...>` — the whole closing sequence in one attested pass. *When:* a change is implemented and ready to finish.
- `doctrina doctor` — aggregate diagnostic with per-finding remedies. *When:* something looks wrong and you do not know which gate to ask.
**Maintain** (triggers: `doctrina <command> --help`) — `doctrina templates list` · `doctrina hooks install` · `doctrina index rebuild` · `doctrina watch` · `doctrina metrics` · `doctrina completion` · `doctrina upgrade --write` · `doctrina ci --emit github`

## What changed in 0.17.0

- Preview a close with `doctrina change check <id>` (it exits 1 while a Verification box is open), then run `doctrina close <id>` — do not run `analyze`, `change apply` or `change archive` by hand; a chore closes the same way.
- Deprecated names still run with a notice — use the replacement: `analyze` → `change check`, `report` → `status --view report`, `skill sync` → `index rebuild`, `templates check|update` → `upgrade [--write]`. `constitution` and `change diff` are removed (exit 2).
- `doctrina upgrade` now reports an installed slash command that still teaches a retired command; run the fix it prints (`doctrina adapter add <agent> --force`).
- `doctrina work "<prompt>" --design` also scaffolds design.md — no need to fall back to `change new` for a change with non-trivial choices.
- A new tasks.md has no Closing steps — the close applies, archives and indexes. `intake --converted` refuses while `validate` reports an error; a change reference is its folder name, never a path (exit 2).

## Stack and tooling

- Runtime: Python 3.11+ (ADR 0002)
- Package manager: pip (`requirements.txt`; config in `pyproject.toml`)
- Test runner: pytest + pytest-playwright, pytest-html, pytest-randomly
- Linter / formatter: ruff (`ruff check`, `ruff format`)

## Commands

```
pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m playwright install chromium  # install
pytest                                    # test (framework checks + e2e)
ruff check . && ruff format --check .     # lint
```

## Repository structure

Tri-Layer of ISTQB CTAL-TAE v2.0 (ADR 0005); dependencies point down only:
`tests/e2e/` test scripts → `business/` (pages, flows, data, fixtures) →
`core/` (SUT-independent). `tests/framework/` self-checks the rules;
`demo_app/` is the demo SUT; `config/<env>.toml` holds non-secret settings.

## Conventions and boundaries

- Specs in `.doctrina/specs/<capability>/spec.md` are the current truth.
- ADRs in `.doctrina/decisions/` are immutable; supersede instead of edit.
- Active change proposals live in `.doctrina/changes/<id>/`.
- Archived changes in `.doctrina/changes/archive/` are out of the default
  read path; consult only when explicitly debugging history.

## Artifact invariants (`doctrina validate` enforces these)

Scaffold with the CLI; do not hand-author from memory. If you must:

- **Headers:** ADRs / proposals / intake use list items
  (`- **Status:** accepted`); specs use bare bold (`**Status:** active`).
- **ADR filename:** `NNNN-slug.md`, four digits. Other shapes are invisible
  to `decision accept`, the index, and the orphan check.
- **Change folder:** `.doctrina/changes/<id>/proposal.md`, that exact name.
- **Spec:** `.doctrina/specs/<cap>/spec.md`; its `**Version:**` must equal
  the version recorded in `index.json`.
- **Every artifact** is registered in `index.json`, and every indexed path
  exists. Update the index in the same change.

Finish by running `doctrina validate` and resolving every `error:`.

## How to read context efficiently

`doctrina context [<capability>] --concat` assembles the read pack in one
call: this `AGENTS.md` → `product.md` → the capability spec → open changes →
accepted ADRs. Run it for ANY task; it skips `changes/archive/`. Skills are
on demand: read the `description:` / `when:` frontmatter in
`.doctrina/skills/` and load a body only when its trigger fires.

Keep this file under 150 lines. The scaffold already spends most of them
and the generated block above grows with the CLI — `doctrina doctor`
reports what is left. Density beats prose.

## Definition of done

`doctrina close <id>` is the definition: tasks checked, deltas merged into
specs, gates green, ADRs recorded and accepted, change archived, index
updated. If close refuses, the change is not done.

## What never goes in this file

Tutorials, project history, secrets, generated content, session notes.
